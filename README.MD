## Synopsis

Ampla. A global resource decision game made using Visual Basic and .NET and Visual Studio.

## Motivation

Fun way to learn about Visual Basic, .NET, and collaborative software development. This was for a third year Computer Science course in software engineering methodologies. Fun program to make with a classmate for the class project.

## Installation

I recommend creating a new VB .NET project in Visual Studio and adding the files to that.
